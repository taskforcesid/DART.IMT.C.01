/*
When Rémi came to the US (to visit Petra to make this MOOC) he brought
his favorite cookie recipe! When trying to bake the cookies he realized that 
ovens in the US show temperature in degrees Fahrenheit, but the cookie recipe 
called for a temperature in degrees Celsius. We need your help!

Please write a C-program that reads a decimal number representing a temperature 
in degrees Celsius and prints out the corresponding temperature in degrees 
Fahrenheit with 1 decimal place. Here is the conversion formula:

Temperature (°F) = Temperature (°C) × 9.0 / 5.0 + 32.0

#include <stdio.h>

int main (){
    double tempF=0.0, tempC=0.0;
    //get tempC
    
    scanf("%lf", &tempC);
    tempF = tempC * (9.0 / 5.0) + 32.0;
    
    printf("%.1lf\n",tempF);
    return 1;
}
